# Airplane-Accident-Severity-Prediction
This challenge was posted in Hacker Earth. (https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/how-severe-can-an-airplane-accident-be-03e7a3f1/)

To predict the Airplane accident severity Decision Tree Algorithm is implemented.

The dataset is preprocessed to Standard Scaler normaliztion of the sklearn. Using the KFold cross validation the apporximate accuracy of a SVC and Decision Tree Classification is obtained. Among the two algorithm Decision Tree Classification algorithm predicted the accident severity with better accuracy. 

The training dataset is fit using the Decision Tree algorithm and its predictions on the test dataset is saved to a csv file.
