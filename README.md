# Airplane-Accident-Severity-Prediction
This challenge was posted in Hacker Earth. (https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/how-severe-can-an-airplane-accident-be-03e7a3f1/)

To predict the Airplane accident severity Decision Tree Algorithm is implemented.

The dataset is preprocessed to Standard Scalar normalization of the sklearn. Using the K-Fold cross validation the approximate accuracy of a SVC and Decision Tree Classification is obtained. Among the two algorithms Decision Tree Classification algorithm predicted the accident severity with better accuracy.

The training dataset is fit using the Decision Tree algorithm and its predictions on the test dataset is saved to a csv file.
